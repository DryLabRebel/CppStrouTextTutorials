The Zen of Programming
======================

The purpose of this document is to:

- try to take notes, and clarify general principles and transferabble concepts fo programming that are generally relevant and applicable to essentially all software development
- Sketch out a clear plan for how to read this text quickly and minimise any resistance I have to just picking it up and reading it, whenever I have some time
