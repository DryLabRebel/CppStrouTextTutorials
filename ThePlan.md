The Plan
========

Read
----

- whenever you get the chance
- let it be your default way to kill 5 minutes
  - train
  - bus
  - after the kids are in bed
  - before bed
  - on the toilet
  - during meetings (heh)
- take notes on stuff you think is important, or might forget
- keep a bookmark on your phone (or the back of your hand)
- keep track of what exercises and example code you need to run on your phone (or the back of your hand)


How to read and absorb like a sponge
------------------------------------



---

- The plan is to read this book... instead of:
  - web surfing
  - social media
  - generally wasting time
  - watching YouTube videos

I have a copy on my phone, my laptop and a paperback copy
  - I can read it anytime, anywhere
  - on the train
  - on lunchbreaks
  - before bed

I can take notes.
- on my phone
- on my mac

I need a plan to be able to:

- read whenever I feel like it
  - be able to take notes, and compile them, probably into the current directory (`~/code/cpp/CppStrouTextTutorials`)
  - keep track of where in the book I am, so I can jump to it no matter what book version I'm reading (paper, mac, phone)
  - keep track of where I'm up to with the in book exercises

So hopefully, all I have to do is, whenever I get a chance, just read...

- note down the page number of any practical exercises or example code to try out
  - set time aside each week (maybe an hour or so each day) to work through example code, and exercises on my macbook
- the most important thing is I'm reading through it, and making progress, keeping up with the examples as often as possible

***This is not meant to take up any ordinary work time, or other commitments. I just want to read this, instead of other stuff on my reading list, for the time being***
  - I can read prayer books, specifically during set blogging time blocks

- I should be able to quickly whip out my phone, whenever I get a chance and tear through a page here and there, in short bursts
- I should be able to just have a read of my paper text, at night in bed
- Whenever I don't feel like 'working' this book needs to be my go-to, a lazy Friday afternoon, I should be able to whip it out and do some reading

What about when I *really* don't feel like reading
--------------------------------------------------

Be tough.

When you don't 'feel' like reading it, remind yourself that you don't have to 'really concentrate' or 'work hard', you can just read it... a little bit at a time.
  - take notes when you feel the need to
  - set the examples and exercises aside for when you can sit down and concentrate on them
  - focus on reading, and just doing your best to get through it and understand it
  - let the real knowledge and understanding grow when you set time aside to finish it

If you really, *really* don't feel like reading - assume it's because you don't feel like doing anything, and just want to rest your eyes and head

This book will teach you how to be and think like a programmer
  - it will teach you how to think about, and go about, using code to solve problems you have, and do things you want it to do
  - hopefully it will give you the confidence to jump into any language, and get the basics down quickly, when you have a specific job to do
